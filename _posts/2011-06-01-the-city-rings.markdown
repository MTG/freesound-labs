**The City Rings** (TCR) is an international sound pedagogy project initiated by [Aifoon](http://aifoon.org), [MTG/Sons de Barcelona](http://barcelona.freesound.org) and [Sound&Music](http://www.soundandmusic.org) and actually being developed in the frame of Sounds of Europe.

The main goal of TCR is to encourage young people to exchange experiences about the place where they live through sound. Our main approach is a series of artist-led workshops that are held simultaneously in schools in various countries.

During these workshops pupils are introduced to creative ways of listening, recording, editing and composing with sound; with an emphasis on the sounds of their everyday life and surroundings. Sounds and compositions are exchanged amongst schools using Freesound, and are used as a basis for reflection and sound appreciation, as well as forming material for new exercises. Sessions descriptions, images and sounds are made public through this blog, where pupils can comment on each otherâ€™s work and where other people can follow their efforts.

Please, click on the Sonic Postcards link above and select a session/activity from the right-hand menu to access descriptions, images and sounds. Find out about the schools involved here.

Thanks for visiting!
