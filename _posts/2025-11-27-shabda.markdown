**Shabda** is a tool for assembling and sharing groups of short (< 5 seconds) audio samples sourced from Freesound's collection.
It fetches a master sample from [Freesound](https://freesound.org) based on a given keyword, and creates the collection based on audio similarity, making it easy to use the collection's samples in improvisation sessions with live-coding environments such as Tidal Cycles, Estuary and Strudel.
The user can filter the samples based on the license with which they were published. 
Shabda can also be used for generating text-to-speech samples on the fly during a live-coding session.
