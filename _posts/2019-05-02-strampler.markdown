* An **open source** eurorack sample streaming and sound synthesis module.
* Half streamer, half sampler, therefore called Strämpler (close to German word of Strampler meaning romper suit).
* Allows streaming of large audio files from SD card (limit 2GB file size due to FAT32 used).
* A eurorack modular synth module with 22 HP width and an internet connection.
* A bridge to connect to Freesound, to play with samples within your modular synth setup.
* Allows tweaking of your sound just like you’d do with a sampler + a modular synth.
* Allows to parameter tweak and modulate sounds by control voltage (CV), employing a complex modulation matrix.

You'll find more details and how to contribute in the project [code repository](https://github.com/ctag-fh-kiel/ctag-straempler).
