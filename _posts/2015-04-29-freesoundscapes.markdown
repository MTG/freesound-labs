**Freesoundscapes** is a sound scapes creator using the [Freesound](http://www.freesound.org) database, coded for the Music Hack Day 2011 in 48 hours. You can search for audiofiles and position them in a 2-dimensional space which will affect the volume and panning of the samples. Works better with Google Chrome.
