**Abstract**<br>
The habit of sharing media online has created a platform with great potential for creative applications that are accessible to large numbers of users with very different backgrounds. As an example, a lively community has grown around Freesound.org to share sound les typically to be reused in music and multimedia content. However, in order to fully realize this potential, new interfaces are needed beyond concept searching to discover interesting multimedia content. We describe Freesound Radio, an experimental environment that allows users to collectively explore the content in Freesound.org by listening to combinations of sounds represented using a graph data structure. Users can create new combinations from scratch or from existing ones. A continuous supply of potential combinations is provided by a genetic algorithm for the radio to play.
