Welcome to Dappledark Studios. Our focus is to help you create amazing tunes.
We created **Lockdown Composer** to help you focus on producing polished songs. 
Whether you need inspiration and ideas to complete your unfinished loops or create songs from scratch, the Composer provides a performance-oriented environment, including some amazing audio units, to help you create, arrange and master complete songs very quickly.
A cool aspect of the Composer is that it uses the awesome WebAudio API, which means you simply point your browser and the Composer is ready â€¦ just launch the Composer and start using it.
