Freesound API demos is a set of user interfaces for querying the [Freesound](http://www.freesound.org) database that showcase the capabilities of the **Freesound APIv2**. They also serve as an example of pure client-based development, based on the [Javascript Freesound APIv2 client](https://github.com/g-roma/freesound.js).

- *Recorder* shows how to upload sounds to Freesound directly from the browser.
- *Scatterplot* organizes the results of a text query based on [Essentia](http://essentia.upf.edu) descriptors
- *cbsearch* shows how to query the Freesound database with a selection of Essentia content-based descriptors, both using target-based querying and filter-based querying.
- *Sounds* is a custom interface for searching short sounds using  content-based descriptors. Sounds, notes and chords can be found based on the energy, and for pitched sounds note and octave.
- *Loops* allows you to find loops based on tempo and musical key using Essentia descriptors
