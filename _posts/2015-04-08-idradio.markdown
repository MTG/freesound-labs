**idRadio** is an interactive web platform created by artist [Xavier Bonfill](http://xavierbonfill.com), through which anyone can interact with the sounds recorded in [The Sound of Cultures](/educational/soundofcultures.html) project and mix them to create different compositions online in real time. This project has the support of La obra Social La Caixa.
