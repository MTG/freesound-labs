**Soundscape Generator** is an app that adds a soundtrack to your photos. As explained by the authors "We were thinking of photos and what they’re lacking. It’s great to be able to look at pictures of moments and either imagine what it would be like, or remember what it was like to be there, but couldn’t they be a bit more immersive? Well of course! What if you could hear what it was like as well?". Users can simply choose or upload a photo and a list of objects in the image is automatically created. Then, after the press of a button, the app finds audio clips appropriate for each of the objects. Finally, playing all those clips together creates a realistic soundscape for the image!
