[Blender](https://www.blender.org) is a free and open source 3D creation suite. This Freesound add-on for Blencder (2.0 and 2.80) allows you to browse, listen and insert sounds from the freesound.org archive in your Blender VSE. An API key is required: you can request it from http://freesound.org/apiv2/apply (Freesound login is required) The plugin documentation button opens the API freesound page as well. You'll find more information in the project's website.
