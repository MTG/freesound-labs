**Sound Maps of the Nature** is a project supported by of the [Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología (FECYT)](http://www.fecyt.es/fecyt/home.do;jsessionid=9B15845EDD42C3149E6E5FCBBC02B717), which aim is to promote the knowledge and the interest of the secondary and high school students for the nature and the technology through the work with sounds. The project includes two actions: a series of workshops with students about listening, recording the sounds of nature and creating a sound map of natural areas for the study and preservation of sound heritage of nature. And secondly, the creation of a set of teaching materials to facilitate other organizations can replicate these workshops.
All audio material as well as the map are shared on the platform [Freesound](www.freesound.org). The overall objective of this project is to promote interest in careers related to natural sciences and sound technologies.
