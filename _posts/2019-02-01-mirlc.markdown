**MIRLC** consists of a set of [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io) extensions for using Music Information Retrieval (MIR) techniques in live conding. In particular, MIRLC includes the MIRLCRep class which is designed for repurposing audio samples from **Freesound** (using and expanding the already existing Freesound *quark* for SuperCollider). This allows to easily search, download and integrate Freesound audio clips in a live coding environment and also keep track of which sounds were used and their licenses. Here is a video of a live performance by the author of MIRLC demonstrating the use if MIRLCRep:
