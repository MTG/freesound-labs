**Abstract**<br>
This paper proposes a music representation for collaborative music creation using shared repositories of audio samples. We explore the use of the graph grammar formalism to organize collective work on musical compositions stored as graphs of samples, and describe an experimental prototype that implements this concept. We then use the compositions created by dierent users with the prototype to show how this representation allows tracking and analyzing the music creation process. Potential applications of this include nding similarities between artists or suggesting sounds for a given compositional context.
