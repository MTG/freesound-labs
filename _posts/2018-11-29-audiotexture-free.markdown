[Le Sound](https://lesound.io), an audio plugin manufacturer based in France, has released [AudioTexture Free](https://lesound.io/product/audiotexture-free/), a free version of their [AudioTexture](https://lesound.io/product/audiotexture/) plugin that allows to generate infinite sounds, variations or loops based on Freesound content.

AudioTexture Free includes an integrated browser to search in Freesound and download sounds that then can be loaded and transformed in the plugin. This allows a fast integration of Freesound content inside DAWs or other media production tools.

The following video shows how AudioTexture allows to transform a sound after it has been loaded from Freesound:
