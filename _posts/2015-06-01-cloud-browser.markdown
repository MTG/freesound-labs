**Cloud Browser** is an audio plugin (VST, AudioUnit, AAX) that letâ€™s you scour the web, searching for samples from [Soundcloud](http://www.soundcloud.com) and [Freesound](http://www.freesound.org). You can preview the samples immediately, and then drag-n-drop clips into your DAW for immediate use in your recording projects.

Cloud Browser gives you links to the artists pages, and licensing requirements of all samples. This means that you know immediately if you can use the samples commercially. You can filter for commercially viable samples so you can be sure that you give the appropriate attributions to sound creators.
