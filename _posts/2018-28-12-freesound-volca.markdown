Volca-Freesound is an online app to load samples on the Korg [Volca Sample](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/volca_sample/).
It selects random samples from the [Freesound](https://freesound.org) database. So it’s not a sample manager like [Vosyr](https://www.frederikson-labs.com/) or [Caustic Editor](http://www.singlecellsoftware.com/cevs). This app chooses random samples by itself. You can only control the maximum length of the samples and which Volca slots to overwrite, but not much else.

The app is a sort of ‘sample randomizer’. Use it to bring new life to your Volca Sample. Let it create a selection of new and unexpected samples that might inspire you to create new music.

The Volca-Freesound app is online at
