**Freesound Timeline** is a very simple hack that gets the most popular sounds in [Freesound](https://freesound.org) for a given year and month and plays them all at once, in loop, and spatialized in a 3D space. You can experiment with two measures for popularity and different density levels for the generated soundscapes. Also you can copy/paste the URL of the generated soundscapes and share it with your friends. Freesound Timeline is your time machine for exploring Freesound!

This hack was originally implemented in 2011 when I was starting to learn about web technologies. It has been recently updated to use Freesound APIv2, the Web Audio API (including random HRTF panning for each sound!) and to include some other nice improvements.
