**Sounds of Barcelona** is a project that aims to promote interest in sound and sound technologies as a means to understand and influence our surroundings. We organize workshops where participants learn to listen, think and work with the sound of our environment, through exercises and creative strategies. The project also emphasizes the dissemination and collaborative networking using blogs and public open licenses.

Sons de Barcelona started in 2008 around the project [Freesound](http://www.freesound.org) developed by the Music Technology Group, a platform for sharing free sounds. The Sounds of Barcelona project is developed by a team of professionals related to education, artistic creation and technology, and is done in collaboration with different institutions. It has been recognized nationally and internationally: in 2011 the project received an Award from the Consell Audiovisual de Catalunya, and in 2012 it has been recognised with the EngageU Award (European Competition for Best Innovations in University Outreach and Public Engagement) by Oxford Internet Institute .
