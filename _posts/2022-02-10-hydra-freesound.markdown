**hydra-freesound-auto** is a self-livecoding system made by Naoto Hieda that searches for a keyword on freesound and plays back the sound with several effects. The tags of the sample appear as a text mixed with random adjectives, and the waveform modulates the synthesized imagery generated with Hydra livecoding environment. This work is an outcome of on-the-fly Live-Coding Hacklab at ZKM in January 2022 led by Anna Xambó Sedó. You can access the page on https://hydra-freesound-auto.glitch.me/ (Google Chrome recommended).
