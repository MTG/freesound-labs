**Sounds of Europe** is a project that acknowledges and follows the increase of field recording activity in music, art and sciences in recent years. By field recording activity we mean an artistic practice working with the accidental sounds of our environment. Our aim is to draw up an overall picture of the many different ways of using field recordings, and to explore their signification and effect.

The project has been initiated by [Q-O2](http://www.q-o2.be/) (workspace for experimental music and sound art/ Brussels), [MTG](http://www.mtg.upf.edu/) (Music Technology Group/University Barcelona) / [Sons de Barcelona](http://barcelona.freesound.org/) , [IRZU](http://www.irzu.org/) (Institute for Sonic Arts Research/Ljubljana) and [CRISAP](http://www.crisap.org/) (Creative Research in Sound Arts Practice /University London). Together with associated partners, weâ€™ll set up activities and artistic projects which explore the sounds of the world, thereby stimulating an exchange of experiences, results, and understandings of sound and listening.
