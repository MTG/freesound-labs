[MoodScape Generator](https://github.com/tayjopadmini/MoodScape-Generator), supported by the [Audio Commons initiative](https://www.audiocommons.org/about/), is a web-based tool that automatically generates soundscapes based on mood. The MoodScape Generator is inspired by Frederic Fontâ€™s [Freesound Timeline](https://ffont.github.io/freesound-timeline/). It combines crowd-sourced audio from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) and Machine Learning algorithms, such as the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, to retrieve sounds related to a specific mood. The sounds retrieved are then played together to create a soundscape based on mood.
