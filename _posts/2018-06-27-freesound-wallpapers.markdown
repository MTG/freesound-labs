**Freesound Wallpapers** is an app for creating wallpapers using [Freesound](https://freesound.org)'s tools for generating waveform and spectrogram images. Just load the web app, choose a Freesound ID and a desired width and height, and hit "go!".

The [code that generates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MTG/freesound/master/utils/audioprocessing/processing.py) the waveform and spectrogram images in Freesound was written a number of years ago by [Bram de Jong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bdejong/). The original idea for the *Freesound Wallpaper Generator* app is from [Sebastian Mealla](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smealla/).
