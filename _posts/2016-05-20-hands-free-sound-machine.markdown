Hands-Free Sound Machine is a voice and gesture controlled drum machine built using HTML5, WebAudio API, WebSpeech API and the Freesound API.
It has been developed at the Music Technology Group (Universitat Pompeu Fabra) as a prototype for the MusicBricks H2020 - ICT Innovation Action European project (Grant nr. 644871), and it is based in the [Free Mashine!](Based on http://labs.freesound.org/apps/free-maschine.html) app.

The drum machine can be controlled using your voice, telling it to start, stop, set the tempo and search sounds for each pad. Sounds are retrieved from Freesound. IRCAMâ€™s riot sensor is used to activate and deactivate steps from the sequencer and to set the tempo.
