This dataset contains 7690 10-second audio files in a standardised format, extracted from contributions on the [Freesound](https://freesound.org) archive which were labelled with the "field-recording" tag. Note that the original tagging (as well as the audio submission) is crowdsourced, so the dataset is not guaranteed to consist purely of "field recordings" as might be defined by practitioners. The intention is to represent the content of an archive collection on such a topic, rather than to represent a controlled definition of such a topic.
