This dataset consists of two hdf5 files that contain pre-computed log-mel spectrograms that have been used to to train audio embedding models. 
The dataset is split into a training set and a validation set containing respectively 170793 and 19103 spectrogram patches with their accompanying multi-hot encoded tags from a vocabulary of 1000 tags provided by Freesound users.

More details can be found in "COALA: Co-Aligned Autoencoders for Learning Semantically Enriched Audio Representations" by X. Favory, K. Drossos, T. Virtanen, and X. Serra. ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08386))
