This is a dataset of 600 simulated sound scenes of 45s each representing urban sound environments, simulated using the [simScene Matlab library](https://bitbucket.org/mlagrange/simscene). The dataset is divided in two parts with a train subset (400 scenes) and a test subset (200 scenes) for the development of learning-based models. Each scene is composed of three main sources (traffic, human voices and birds) according to an original scenario, which is composed semi-randomly conditionally to five ambiances: park, quiet street, noisy street, very noisy street and square. Separate channels for the contribution of each source are available. The base audio files used for simulation are obtained from [Freesound](https://freesound.org) and [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12). The sound scenes are scaled according to a playback sound level in dB, which is drawn randomly but remains plausible according to the ambiance.
