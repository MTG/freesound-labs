This is a corpus of 100 sound scenes of 45s each representing urban sound environments, including: 6 scenes recorded in Paris; 19 scenes simulated using [simScene](https://bitbucket.org/mlagrange/simscene) to replicate recorded scenarios, including the 6 recordings in this corpus; 75 scenes simulated using simScene with diverse new scenarios, containing traffic, human voices and bird sources. The base audio files used for simulation are obtained from [Freesound](https://freesound.org) and [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12). The sound scenes are scaled according to a playback sound level in dB, which is drawn randomly but remains plausible according to the ambiance.
