FSDKaggle2019 is an audio dataset containing 29,266 audio files annotated with 80 labels of the [AudioSet Ontology](https://research.google.com/audioset////////ontology/index.html). FSDKaggle2019 has been used for the [DCASE Challenge 2019 Task 2](http://dcase.community/challenge2019/task-audio-tagging), which was run as a Kaggle competition titled [Freesound Audio Tagging 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging-2019). The dataset allows development and evaluation of machine listening methods in conditions of label noise, minimal supervision, and real-world acoustic mismatch. FSDKaggle2019 consists of two train sets and one test set. One train set and the test set consists of manually-labeled data from Freesound, while the other train set consists of noisily labeled web audio data from Flickr videos taken from the [YFCC dataset](http://code.flickr.net/2014/10/15/the-ins-and-outs-of-the-yahoo-flickr-100-million-creative-commons-dataset/).
