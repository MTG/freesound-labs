GISE-51 is an open dataset of 51 isolated sound events based on the FSD50K dataset. The release also includes the GISE-51-Mixtures subset, a dataset of 5-second soundscapes with up to three sound events synthesized from GISE-51. The GISE-51 release attempts to address some of the shortcomings of recent sound event datasets, providing an open, reproducible benchmark for future research and the freedom to adapt the included isolated sound events for domain-specific applications, which was not possible using existing large-scale weakly labelled datasets. GISE-51 release also included accompanying code for baseline experiments, which can be found at https://github.com/SarthakYadav/GISE-51-pytorch.
