The **BSD10k dataset** (Broad Sound Dataset 10k) is an open collection of human-labeled sounds containing over 10,000 [Freesound](https://freesound.org) audio clips, annotated according to the 23 second-level classes defined in the **Broad Sound Taxonomy** (BST). BST is currently being [used in Freesound](https://freesound.org/help/faq/#the-broad-sound-taxonomy) for organization, filtering, and post-processing tasks. The dataset was created at the Music Technology Group of Universitat Pompeu Fabra. For more information about the dataset, download instructions, and citation details, please check the [Zenodo BSD10k page](https://zenodo.org/records/17233904).
