The VocalImitationSet is a collection of crowd-sourced vocal imitations of a large set of diverse sounds collected from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), which were curated based on Google's [AudioSet ontology](https://research.google.com/audioset/). We expect that this dataset will help research communities obtain a better understanding of human's vocal imitation and build a machine understand the imitations as humans do.
