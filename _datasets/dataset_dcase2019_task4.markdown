The synthetic set is composed of 10 sec audio clips generated with [Scaper](https://github.com/justinsalamon/scaper). The foreground events are obtained from a subset of FSD dataset from [Freesound](https://freesound.org). Each event audio clip was verified manually to ensure that the sound quality and the event-to-background ratio were sufficient to be used an isolated event. We also verified that the event was actually dominant in the clip and we controlled if the event onset and offset are present in the clip.
