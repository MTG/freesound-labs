This dataset contains ~4000 user-contributed loops uploaded to [Freesound](https://freesound.org). Loops were selected by searching Freesound for sounds with the query terms `loop` and `bpm`, and then automatically parsing the returned sound filenames, tags and textual descriptions to identify tempo annotations made by users. For example, a sound containing the tag `120bpm` is considered to have a ground truth of 120 BPM.
