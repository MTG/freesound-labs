This dataset contains 10254 one-shot (single event) percussive sounds from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) and the corresponding timbral analysis. These were used to train the generative model for [Neural Percussive Synthesis Parameterised by High-Level Timbral Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11853).
