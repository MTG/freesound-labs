TUT Rare Sound Events 2017 is a dataset used in the [DCASE Challenge 2017 Task 2](http://dcase.community/challenge2017/task-rare-sound-event-detection#audio-dataset), focused on the detection of rare sound events in artificially created mixtures. It consists of isolated sound events for each target class and recordings of everyday acoustic scenes to serve as background. The target sound event categories are: Baby crying, Glass breaking, Gunshot. The background audio is part of TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016 dataset, and the isolated sound examples were collected from Freesound. Selection of sounds from Freesound was based on the exact label, selecting examples that had sampling frequency 44.1 kHz or higher.
