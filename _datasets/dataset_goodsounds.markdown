This dataset was contains monophonic recordings musical instruments playing two kinds of exercises: single notes and scales. The recordings were made in the Universitat Pompeu Fabra / Phonos recording studio by 15 different professional musicians, all of them holding a music degree and having some expertise in teaching, and uploaded to [Freesound](https://freesound.org). 12 different instruments were recorded using one or up to 4 different microphones (depending on the recording session). For all the instruments the whole set of playable semitones in the instrument is recorded several times with different tonal characteristics. Each note is recorded into a separate mono .flac audio file of 48kHz and 32 bits. The tonal characteristics are explained both in the the following section and the related publication.
