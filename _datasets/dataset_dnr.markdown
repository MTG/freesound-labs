Divide and Remaster (DnR) is a source separation dataset for training and testing algorithms that separate a monaural audio signal into speech, music, and sound effects/background stems. The dataset is composed of artificial mixtures using audio from the librispeech, free music archive (FMA), and Freesound Dataset 50k (FSD50k). We introduce it as part of the Cocktail Fork Problem paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09958
