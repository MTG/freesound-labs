DBR dataset is an environmental audio dataset created for the Bachelor's Seminar in Signal Processing in Tampere University of Technology. The samples in the dataset were collected from the online audio database [Freesound](https://freesound.org). The dataset consists of three classes, each containing 50 samples, and the classes are 'dog', 'bird', and 'rain' (hence the name DBR).
