**Freesound Labs**  is a directory of projects, hacks, apps, research and other initiatives that use content from [Freesound](https://www.freesound.org) or use the [Freesound API](https://www.freesound.org/docs/api/). 
Our aim is to keep on updating this directory as soon as we come across more and more of *Freesound powered* projects. Nevertheless, we'll probably miss a lot of interesting things so if you know of something that should be listed in our directory and it is not here, please feel free to tell us by sending us an email (freesound at freesound dot org).


Some of the projects listed in this site are, in fact, hosted in **Freesound Labs**. Do you have a cool web-based project using Freesound and want to host it here? Please, send us an email explaining the project and the hosting requirements and we'll try to do our best to make it happen. The simpler the project, the more chances you have to get it hosted, e.g., static pages are simple to host ;)

**Freesound Labs** is run by the Freesound Team at the [Music Technology Group](http://mtg.upf.edu) of [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](http://www.upf.edu). Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, comments or suggestions.
