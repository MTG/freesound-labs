**Abstract**<br>
Currently proposed tagging ontologies are mostly focused on the definition of a common schema for representing the agents involved in a tagging process. In this paper we describe preliminary research around the idea of extending tagging ontologies by incorporating some domain specific class definitions and relations. We illustrate our idea with a particular use case where a tag recommendation system is driven by such an ontology. Besides our use case, we believe that such extended tagging ontologies can bring more meaningful structure into folksonomies and improve browsing and organisation functionalities of online platforms relying on tagging systems.
