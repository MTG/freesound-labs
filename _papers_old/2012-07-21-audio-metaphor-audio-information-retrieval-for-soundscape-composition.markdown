**Abstract**<br>
Audio Metaphor is a sound file recommender system for soundscape composers and generative systems. An algorithm named SLiCE generates sound file recommendations from the analysis and processing of text-based utterances. A contemporary dance production In[a]moment implemented Audio Metaphor in online performance context. Audience interaction was facilitated processing real-time Tweets from audience. We describe the Audio Metaphor system, SLiCE algorithm, implementation, and audience response.
